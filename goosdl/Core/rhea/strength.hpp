/** Every constraint has a strength that determines where it sits in the
 ** hierarchy; strong constraints are always satisfied in preference
 ** to weaker ones.
 *
 * Since we want to be able to express preferences as well as requirements
 * in the constraint system, we need a specification for how conflicting
 * preferences are to be traded off.  In a constraint hierarchy each
 * constraint has a strength.  The 'required' strength is special, in that
 * required constraints must be satisfied.  The other strengths
 * all label non-required constraints.  A constraint of a given strength
 * completely dominates any constraint with a weaker strength.  In the
 * hierarchy theory, a comparator is used to compare different possible
 * solutions to the constraints and select among them.
 *
 * Within this framework a number of variations are possible.  One decision
 * is whether we only compare solutions on a constraint-by-constraint basis
 * (a \e local comparator), or whether we take some aggregate measure of the
 * unsatisfied constraints of a given strength (a \e global comparator).  A
 * second choice is whether we are concerned only whether a constraint is
 * satisfied or not (a \e predicate comparator), or whether we also want to
 * know how nearly satisfied it is (a \e metric comparator).
 *
 * Constraints whose domain is a metric space, for example the reals, can
 * have an associated error function.  The error in satisfying a constraint
 * is zero if and only if the constraint is satisfied, and becomes larger
 * the less nearly satisfied it is.  For a given collection of constraints,
 * Cassowary finds a \e locally-error-better or a \e weighted-sum-better
 * solution.
